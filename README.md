##### `"This configuration is modular by design‚Äîif you love a part of it, grab that slice, plug it into your Nixvim config, and roll with it!"`

Nvix is a **modular** and **powerful** Neovim configuration built over [Nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim). It leverages the Nix ecosystem to create flexible, reproducible setups for Neovim. Whether you need a minimal config for quick edits or a fully-featured development environment, Nvix has you covered!

## üõ†Ô∏è Why Use Nvix?

- **Fully Modularized**: Every configuration is split into modules, making it easy to use only what you need.
- **Three Configurations**:
  - **Bare**: Minimal setup for quick edits on any server.
  - **Core**: A daily-driver setup with LSP and language support.
  - **Full**: All-in-one, feature-rich setup, including LaTeX support.
- **Customizable**: Import modules individually or override configurations using `config.nvix`.

---

## üìö How to Quick Run Nvix (Without installing)

### Bare Configuration
For a minimal setup with basic mappings and options, ideal for quick edits:
```sh
nix run "github:niksingh710/nvix#bare"
```

### Core Configuration
For a fully-featured daily driver with LSP and language support:
```sh
nix run "github:niksingh710/nvix#core"
```

### Full Configuration
For a comprehensive setup with jumbo packs (e.g., LaTeX support):
```sh
nix run "github:niksingh710/nvix#full"
```

---

## üîß Installation

<details>
  <summary>
  Ensure that you have nix installed on your system and flakes enabled.
  </summary>

#### Nix pkg manager installation

```bash
# This is multiuser installation of nix requires sudo
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```

</details>

#### Add the Nvix repo as an input in your flake:

```nix
inputs = {
  nvix.url = "github:niksingh710/nvix";
};

environment.packages = [
  inputs.nvix.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
];
# Replace `default` with `bare`, `core`, or `full` as needed
```

For further customization, use:

```nix
inputs.nvix.packages.${pkgs.system}.default.extend { }
```

Check the `variables.nix` file or the [Nixvim Wiki](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/platforms/standalone.html?highlight=extend#extending-an-existing-configuration) for additional configuration options.

---

## üèÜ Features

- **Generalized Design**: Use specific modules (e.g., lualine) without adopting the entire configuration.
- **Community-Driven**: Plans to support multiple standardized configurations for popular plugins (e.g., lualine).
- **Lightweight to Full-Featured**: Choose a setup based on your needs.

---

## üî¨ Module Documentation

Each module has its own README with usage details.
The configurations build on one another:
- **Bare**: Minimal setup.
- **Core**: Includes everything in Bare.
- **Full**: Includes everything in Core.

> [!NOTE]
> If you find something undocumented or have a better way of documenting, please share‚Äîit will be integrated. An auto-doc generator would also be a great addition; if you know how to implement one, please share or contribute.
> With time, more relevant plugins will be added.

## üß© FAQs

### What is the purpose of Nvix?
Nvix was initially created as a learning experiment while exploring Nix. Over time, it evolved into a modular and flexible configuration for Neovim.

### Why are there three configurations?
- **Bare**: For lightweight, minimal editing without distractions.
- **Core**: For regular usage with full LSP and language support.
- **Full**: For advanced workflows requiring plugins like LaTeX.

### Can I use specific modules without the full configuration?
**Absolutely!** Nvix is modular, so you can pick and choose modules (e.g., lualine) to include in your setup. This allows you to quickly spin up an editor with your preferences without adopting the full configuration.

### Are there plans for community contributions?
**Yes!** The goal is to include standardized configurations for popular plugins, allowing for user-specific choices via `config.nvix`.

### Why are there limited exposed options in `config.nvix`?
Nixvim already exposes most options for customization. As new standardized configurations are added, more options will be exposed where needed.

---

## üôè How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! Here‚Äôs how you can help:

- Fix typos or improve documentation.
- Suggest better configurations or enhancements.
- Request support for new plugins or options.
- Share your expertise in configuring LSP or plugins for specific languages.

Create an issue or a PR‚ÄîI‚Äôll address it as soon as possible!

---

## üîÑ Example: Using a Module

Initialize a new Nixvim configuration:
```sh
nix flake init -t "github:nix-community/nixvim"
```

Then, add Nvix modules to your configuration:

```nix
# Add Nvix to inputs
inputs = {
  ...
  nvix.url = "github:niksingh710/nvix";
  ...
};

# Import required modules
modules.imports = [
  ./config
  inputs.nvix.nvixModules.utils
  inputs.nvix.nvixModules.lualine
];
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `utils` module is required for most configurations. Some modules depend on custom-packaged plugins‚Äîrefer to their README for details.

---

## ‚úÖ To-Do

- [ ] Add more community-standard configurations.
- [ ] Increase the number of exposed options in `config.nvix`.
- [ ] Improve support for language-specific LSPs.
